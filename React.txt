        ---------------------------

        1.to create react app : npx create-react-app project-name



        concepts & Features
         ------------------------------
          

          1. JS library for building UI
          2. single page application
          3. Declarative :  
          4. Immutability : not changing
          5. Pure functions : it doesnot cause any side effects
          6. virtual DOM - it will take a copy of real DOM and changed Dom, and compare if there is any change and act likes it
          7. Unidirectional data flow : parent to child 
          8. JSX (javascriprt XML)
          9. Transpiling (Converting JSX to js,html) - bebel
          10. to create react app : create-react-app command 
          11. Based on components - is small part of UI,every react app consist of tree components : Parent/Starting component : App component
            -its a js/jsx file with filename starts with capital letter
            -diffferent types of componenet
                -functional component - components created using function - recf
                -class components - componenets created using class - rcc
          12. JSX - javascript XML
            -every tag should contain inside a perent tag
            -every tag should has closing tag
            -empty fragment : <> </>
            -class becomes className 
            - for becomes htmlFor
            - use {js-expression} to provide js expression inside JSX  
            - to style jsx elements using class
              -should be camel case
                 -Inline CSS
                 -External CSS
                -
          13.Props : property of a component can be shared with child components 
                  - it is an object
                  - to acess shared data in child components using props whcich will be argument of the component   

          14.Component Styling using CSS
             - inline CSS 
             - CSS style sheet
             - CSS Module
          15.React Events    
             -without arguments call  function with its name only while bending event
             -with arguments : bind the event with arrow function and call the function inside the event
             -with event as argument : use event object as argument of arrow function

          16. Conditional Rendering   
             - if statement : operator &&
             - if-else statement :ternary operator ?


          17.  React State - its object for class componenet
              - store component property
              - when state changes component re-render(refresh)
              - to change state value ,use setState()
          18. React Component Lifecycle
              -Mounting : putting elements into DOM
                  -constructor()
                  -getDerivedStateFromProps()
                  -render()
                  -componenetDidMount()
              -Updating 
              -Unmounting

          19.React Hooks : To use react features such as state and lifecycle in react functional componenet
            -import hooks and call them inside functional component
            -Hooks can only called at the top level of a component
            -Hook cannot be conditional
            -Types of Hooks
              -Predefined Hooks 
                            -useState() : used to track state in functional component 
              -Custom Hook 

         20. Difereance between functional and class based Hooks    

                   Functional Based Component                           Class Based Component
           ============================================= ================================================         
       1.js pure functionn acccept props and                  1.class requires to extend from React Component
         return JSX (react elements)                              render function return JSX

       2. no need  of  render function                          2.Must use render function to return JSX
      
       3.    Run from top to bottam, once jsx return           3. componenetkeep alive depending on different life cycle phases
               then it cannot be alive
       
       4. Stateless componenet                                 4.Stateful component

       5.Hooks used, counstructor not used                       5.not using hooks,use constructor to initiallize state 



       21.Rendering list (Array of lists) : using map method

       22. React form 
                - handele by react componenet
                - preventDefault()- method cancel the event if it is cancelable (it will not refresh)

      23,API call in react Using AXIOS : ppromise based API call     

      24.Routing - set up path for component in react     
              -use react-router-dom library path
